0001-fix-compile-error-on-raring.dif:
    This patch fixes a compile error on Ubuntu 13.04 (raring).
    The unpatched version complains about a missing gets. This
    results from a over-ambitious check in some stdio.h replacement
    that is created in compile time. The patch simply disables
    this check.
